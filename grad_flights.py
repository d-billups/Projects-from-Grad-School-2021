# For this problem, you will be working with flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. For development, these data are a little largeish (~700Mb/7 million flights) for prototyping, so two truncated files are provided under 'data/2007-005.csv' and 'data/2008-005.csv'. Important: it's strongly recommended to prototype and develop code using the truncated data.
# 
# Design note: The code you will develop as part of this problem's solution should be generalized so that it works when there are more than just two years' worth of data, i.e. when there are more files than just for years 2007 and 2008. Additionally, all refernce outputs are presented for the half-percent annual flight sample (small files).

# A1. (4 points) To start, complete the function to take a year as an input argument and load its data into a pandas dataframe. This load should drop the rows in the dataframe that have a null in any of these columns: "Year", "Month", "DayofMonth", "DepTime", "Origin", and "Dest", and then return the result

The function must now return all flights originating from the specified airport within this range of time. If the range spans more than two years, it should load data from all necessary files (i.e., assume more than two year-files exist) and return a single dataframe containing all the data within the specified range of time.
